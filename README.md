# Predicting Car Prices using KNN
In this project I am using a k-nearest neighbors algorithm to predict a car's market price using its attributes.
To see the analysis open the [notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MWiechmann/predict_car_prices_knn/blob/main/Predicting%20Car%20Prices%20using%20KNN.ipynb).

## Dataset used in this project
I will be using UCI's Automobile Data Set. This data contains car data from the 1985 Ward's Automotive Yearbook and can be downloaded here.
